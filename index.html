<h2 class="special">Intro.</h2>
The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films are a series of American superhero films produced by Marvel Studios based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. The MCU is the shared universe in which all of the films are set. The films have been in production since 2007, and in that time Marvel Studios has produced and released 23 films, with at least nine more in various stages of development. It is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $22.5 billion at the global box office.

<h2>Release</h2>
<h3>Home Media</h3>
In June 2012, Marvel announced a 10-disc box set titled "Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One � Avengers Assembled", for release on September 25, 2012. The box set includes all six of the Phase One films�Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, and Marvel's The Avengers�on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D, in a replica of Nick Fury's briefcase from The Avengers. In August 2012, luggage company Rimowa GmbH, who developed the briefcase for The Avengers, filed suit against Marvel Studios and Buena Vista Home Entertainment in U.S. federal court, complaining that "Marvel did not obtain any license or authorization from Rimowa to make replica copies of the cases for any purpose." The set was delayed to early 2013 for the packaging to be redesigned. The box set, with a redesigned case, was released on April 2, 2013. In addition, the box set included a featurette on the then-upcoming Phase Two films, showing footage and concept art, as well as previously unreleased deleted scenes from all of the Phase One films.

<h2>Avengers: Endgame</h2>
Avengers: Endgame is the highest grossing movie of all time
Just when hope seemed lost, Avengers: Endgame pushed a little further and usurped Avatar as the highest grossing movie of all time. It is now up to $2.795 billion, besting Avatar's $2.789 billion which stood as the top mark for nearly a decade.

The acheivement is a testament to the power of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now, as the dust settles from the events of Avengers: Endgame (and Spider-Man: Far From Home), we can look foward to the future of Marvel, which has some crazy surprises in store for us.
